# [YouTube ID: UeheTiBJ0Io] Integrating Keras & TensorFlow - The Keras workflow, expanded (TensorFlow Dev Summit 2017)
## Toy Video QA problem on Keras
## My practice code (jupyter notebook): https://github.com/hcchengithub/Toy-Video-QA-problem-on-Keras

The code shown on the YouTube video does not work. I have fixed all problems but now . . . don't know how to play yet. 
Please give me a tiny hint throught opening an issue, thank you very very much! 

This command line:

    jupyter nbconvert \"experimenting the source code.ipynb\"  --to script

converts this jupyter notebook into a .py normal python script file.
