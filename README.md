# [YouTube ID: UeheTiBJ0Io] Integrating Keras & TensorFlow - The Keras workflow, expanded (TensorFlow Dev Summit 2017)
## Toy Video QA problem on Keras
## My practice code (jupyter notebook): https://github.com/hcchengithub/Toy-Video-QA-problem-on-Keras

The code shown on the YouTube video does not work. I have fixed all problems but now . . . don't know how to play yet. 
Please give me a tiny hint throught opening an issue, thank you very very much! 

## How to run 

#### Method 1, run jupyter notebook 

jupyter notebook is a wonderful playground for python.
If you have no idea what's a 'jupyter notebook' then it's time to install, google that, and try:

    pip install ipython
    pip install jupyter 
    jupyter notebook "experimenting the source code.ipynb"

#### Method 2, run .py 
This command line:

    jupyter nbconvert \"experimenting the source code.ipynb\"  --to script

converts the jupyter notebook into a .py normal python script file so you can run it then.
